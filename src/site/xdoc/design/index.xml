	<p>The MILabel provides the ability to automatically generate values that do not map directly to the input data object (i.e. PDS3 label).  The following procedure provides the steps for adding a <i>Global Generated Value</i>.  This should only be extended for those generated values that will apply to multiple nodes.  See the proceeding procedure for <i>Node-Specific Generated Values</i>.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Check out the <a href="http://starcell.jpl.nasa.gov/repo/2010/trunk/preparation/generate/">source</a> for the Generate Tool.</li>
	  <li>Create a new class in the src/main/java/gov/nasa/pds/imaging/generate/automatic/elements directory implementing the <a href="http://starcell.jpl.nasa.gov/repo/2010/trunk/preparation/generate/src/main/java/gov/nasa/pds/imaging/generate/automatic/elements/Element.java">Element interface</a> with the functionality necessary in order to fulfill the generated element's requirements.</li>
	  <li>Open the generated mappings configuration file, <a href="http://starcell.jpl.nasa.gov/repo/2010/trunk/preparation/generate/src/main/resources/conf/generated-mappings.xml">generated-mappings.xml</a>.</li>
	  <li>Create a new element class with the <i>context</i> and <i>class</i> according the newly created class.</li>
